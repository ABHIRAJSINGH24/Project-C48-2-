Story and Goal:-
Hey, guys! I am making a game in which our planet is about to be attacked by an alien race. The only person who can stop them is you. Use your spaceship to destroy the incoming asteroids and the enemy spaceships. Use the arrow keys to move left or right and the space key to use your gun. Good luck in your mission as you are the hero who can save Earth.

Characters:-
PC - Spaceship
NPC - Asteroids and enemy spaceships

Background:-
I have created the game in such a way that you would feel that you are alone in space until an asteroid or spaceship comes out of nowhere.

Platform Used:-
Visual Studio Code (VSC)
